    <p>
A startup can begin with just a simple idea, but it has to be put into practice. Coming up with a new idea is easy. Committing your time and resources to follow true, now that's the tricky part.
</p>
    <p >
I first started repairing computers in 2015. I always wanted to have my own little start-up business. I have been coming back to the idea every few months but i've been afraid to commit to one idea.

        </p>
    <p>
But in September of 2017 when I was approached by a colleague of mine, Rajesh Ganesh, with the same idea, I accepted. 
    </p>
<div class="aqualogo"></div>  
      <p>My business partner and I then came up with the idea of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AquaTech03">Aqua-tech </a>, a small computer repair service mainly operating in the Turkeyen.<br><br> Our target market was initially University Students but quickly expanded to customers around Georgetown and small business without an IT department.</p>
    <p>
    Our main goal at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AquaTech03">Aqua-tech </a> is to provide timely and improved services. We want to provide fast on-site or in-store service. <br><br>
    We plan on accomplising our goal by keeping up with the latest technology and hiring the best if needed.
    </p>
    <p>Our current objective is finding new customers. This can be accomplished by advertising and marketing. We plan on volunteering to help maintain a non-profit organization's (such as a local church) website.</p>
    
    <p> This we hope, can attract some unexpected clients. While also spreading brand awareness. Another way we plan on giving back to the community is by providing some much needed tech tips.</p>

      <h3>Aqua-Tech Tip #1</h3>
      <p style="color: aliceblue">When cleaning a component or your entire computer, you should turn it off before cleaning.<br><br> Never spray or squirt any liquid onto any computer component.<br><br> This can lead to hardware damage.</p>

      <h3>Aqua-Tech Tip #2</h3>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">Never ever sit your laptop on a couch cushion, or on a mattress, or anything soft.<br><br> This hinders airflow through the little slot on the bottom and sides of your machine causing your fans and laptop to work harder. </p>

      <h3>Aqua-Tech Tip #4</h3>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">Pressing Windows button + ‘L’ will lock your computer immediately and you will need password to access it again (if the password is set).<br><br>

This is very useful to quickly lock your PC when you leaving the desk for some time.<br></p>
