<h1>Company Profile</h1>  
    <hr>
    <p align="justify">Beepats was founded by Madho Beepat who started out from humble beginnings as a one-man operation in the La Penitence Market (down trade) in November 1953. Mr. Beepat’s business soon out grew the stall in the market and he moved to rented premises at 95 Regent Street, Georgetown where he later purchased the said property. </p>

          <p align="justify">His success continued and he managed to acquire the land site at 100-101 Regent Street which is the head office and main wholesale/retail of the business today. Being one of the first persons to start business in Regent Street, Mr. Madho Beepat was instrumental in making Regent Street into the hub of commercial activity it is  today.</p>
